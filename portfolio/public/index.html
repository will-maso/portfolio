      <h4>NC News Frontend</h4>
      <p>
        This app allows you to view news articles. The list of articles is intially populated with all the articles in the db
        nicely paginated for ease of access.
        Articles can then be sorted using a variety of parameters in the drop down menu. Comments can be viewed on each article
        and comments can be added by existing users,
        as well as upvotes being added by only existing users.<br>

      <h4>NC News Backend</h4>
      <p>
        This project is a backend project that houses a database containing articles, users, comments and topics tables
        each of which is interlinked and provides multiple endpoints from which you can extract useful information.<br>

      </p>
      <h4>DnDinder</h4>
      <p>
        This project is a meeting place for DnD players, it allows them to create a user profile,
        they are also able to create groups and add other users to their group. On the group page the dungeon master's email
        will be displayed to allow them to organise a game,
        we plan to add a chat functionality in the future. All of this is done using firebase aswell as cloud functions to make
        a serverless backend,
        while the frontend uses React.<br>

      <h2>Work History</h2>
      <h3>Sainsbury's</h3>
      <p>
        I worked in food services, a customer facing role which I feel this gave me good people skills as well as forging
        relationships with people I would otherwise never have met nor interacted with had I not been an employee. I provided an
        excellent customer experience and was complimented on my excellent customer service skills.
